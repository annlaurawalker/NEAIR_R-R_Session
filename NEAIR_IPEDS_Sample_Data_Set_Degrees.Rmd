### Chunk #2--Opening Packages
```{r, message=FALSE}
# This is to be run every time you use this R Markdown document
library(dplyr) # Data Manipulation
library(knitr) # R Markdown files
library(readr) # Reading data into R
library(tidyr) # Data Transformation
```

### Chunk #3--Setting the Working Directory
```{r, message=FALSE}
getwd()

# 1 Open Windows Explorer
# 2 Navigate to C Drive
# 3 Select "Users"
# 4 Select Desktop
# 5 Copy the Address **BE SURE TO REPLACE THE "\" WITH "/"
setwd("c:/Users/alwalker/Desktop/NEAIR Presentation")
```
### Chunks #4--Naming objects
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Format of and R object
title <- "You_R_What_You_Code"

year <- 2020
```

### Chunks #5--Reading in Data--There are many ways to do this
#### Method 1--Not Through and Through the Working directory
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# This file could be read into R without setting a working directory but you would have to run (without #): 
# degrees <- read_csv("c:/Users/alwalker/Desktop/NEAIR Presentation/NEAIR_IPEDS_Sample_Data_Set_Degrees.csv"). 
# This should not be run if you DID set a directory because doing both would cause an error.

# Reading data in (readr package)
# Because you set a working directory, all you'll have to do is refer to the file by name when reading it into R. 
degrees <- read_csv("NEAIR_IPEDS_Sample_Data_Set_Degrees.csv")

rm(title, year)

#### Method 2--Through R Studio's Import Data Function (refer to NEAIR's video to view)

#### Method 3--Code for getting data straight from the Internet
degrees <- read.csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/annlaurawalker/NEAIR_R-R_Session/master/NEAIR_IPEDS_Sample_Data_Set_Degrees.csv"))

```

### Seeing, Renaming, and Rearranging Column Names
#### Chunk #6--Seeing a List of Column Names
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

#### Chunk #7--Renaming Column Names
```{r, message=FALSE}

#### Chunk #8--Rearranging Columns
```{r, message=FALSE}

You'll see that the "total" variable's name is "degrees_total" and, in line 274, I called the total variable "count_phd_degrees_total." Learn from this mistake. The original total variable was going to be the long "count_phd_degrees_total" but I had revised it to something smaller "degrees_total" and I didn't do all the edits. Line 276 has the correct line of code.
